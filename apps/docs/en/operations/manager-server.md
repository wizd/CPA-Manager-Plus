# Manager Server Guide

Manager Server is the backend for the full CPAMP experience. It hosts `management.html`, stores local SQLite data, consumes the CPA usage queue through the collector, and protects management capabilities with the CPAMP Admin Key.

Most users do not need to read this page from top to bottom. Start with the document that matches your task:

This page is mainly for advanced deployments that need environment variables, custom collection networking, runtime endpoints, or data-directory control.

When you open this entry point, you are using Manager Server mode:

```text
http://<host>:18317/management.html
```

When CPA itself serves this entry point, you are using the CPAMP Lightweight Panel:

```text
http://<cpa-host>:8317/management.html
```

The CPAMP Lightweight Panel does not connect to or read Manager Server SQLite and does not provide full historical monitoring, model prices, API key aliases, import/export, or server inspection history.

## What Manager Server Does

Manager Server:

- Serves the embedded management panel.
- Runs first setup or reads an environment-managed CPA connection.
- Authenticates users with the `cpamp_...` admin key.
- Encrypts setup/panel-saved CPA Management Keys with `data.key`.
- Proxies CPA Management API calls after setup.
- Consumes CPA usage events.
- Persists usage events in SQLite.
- Provides Dashboard, Request Monitoring, Usage Analytics, Model Pricing, API Key Alias, Usage Import/Export, and Server Codex Inspection APIs.

::: details Advanced: architecture and data flow

## Architecture

```text
Browser
  -> Manager Server :18317
      -> /management.html
      -> /usage-service/info
      -> /usage-service/config
      -> /v0/management/usage              from SQLite
      -> /v0/management/model-prices       from SQLite
      -> /v0/management/api-key-aliases    from SQLite
      -> /v0/management/dashboard/*        from SQLite
      -> /v0/management/monitoring/*       from SQLite
      -> /v0/management/codex-inspection/* from SQLite / background workers
      -> other /v0/management/*            proxied to CPA
      -> collector -> CPA usage queue
      -> /data/usage.sqlite
```

CPA still runs separately. CPAMP does not bundle CPA.

:::

## First Setup And Login

On first startup, CPAMP needs an admin key. You can provide one:

```bash
CPA_MANAGER_ADMIN_KEY='replace-with-a-long-random-admin-key'
```

If not configured, Manager Server generates:

```text
cpamp_...
```

and prints it once in the startup logs.

First setup asks for:

```text
Admin Key
CPA URL
CPA Management Key
Request Monitoring
Collection Mode
Poll Interval
```

After setup:

- Browser login uses the CPAMP admin key.
- Setup/panel-saved CPA Management Keys are stored server-side and encrypted.
- In a manual env/secret deployment, Manager Server reads the CPA URL and CPA Management Key from the deployment environment; the one-click installer imports that input once into encrypted SQLite configuration.
- Manager Server uses the resolved CPA Management Key when calling CPA.
- New browsers no longer need the CPA Management Key.

## CPA Prerequisites

Request monitoring requires CPA usage publishing and the CPA usage queue.

Minimum:

```text
CPA v6.10.8+ for HTTP usage queue
```

Recommended:

```text
CPA v7.1.39+
```

CPA Management API must be enabled:

```yaml
remote-management:
  secret-key: 'your CPA Management Key'
  allow-remote: true
```

Usage publishing can be enabled by CPAMP during setup/config save, or directly in CPA:

```yaml
usage-statistics-enabled: true
```

Queue retention is controlled by CPA:

```yaml
redis-usage-queue-retention-seconds: 60
```

Default retention is 60 seconds and the maximum is 3600 seconds. Keep Manager Server running continuously.

## Collection Mode

Default:

```text
auto
```

Behavior:

```text
auto -> RESP Pub/Sub -> HTTP usage queue -> RESP pop fallback
```

| Mode        | Use when                                                           |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `auto`      | Recommended default.                                               |
| `subscribe` | Force RESP Pub/Sub for low-latency direct CPA API access.          |
| `http`      | Force HTTP usage queue, useful behind normal HTTP reverse proxies. |
| `resp`      | Force legacy RESP pop; must directly reach the CPA API port.       |

RESP transports cannot pass through a normal HTTP reverse proxy. If you see `unsupported RESP prefix 'H'`, the RESP client is probably connecting to an HTTP endpoint.

## Configuration Boundary

Managed by Manager Server:

- Bound CPA URL.
- Encrypted CPA Management Key.
- Request monitoring switch.
- Collection mode, poll interval, batch size, and query limit.
- SQLite usage data.
- Model pricing data.
- API Key aliases.
- Server inspection history.

Still managed by CPA:

- `usage-statistics-enabled`
- `redis-usage-queue-retention-seconds`
- `remote-management`
- proxy and routing config
- logging config
- auth files
- provider config
- CPA `config.yaml`

Saving CPAMP configuration does not rewrite the full CPA `config.yaml`.

Startup precedence:

Temporarily enable the loopback-only pprof server when diagnosing CPU, heap, or goroutine behavior:

```bash
CPA_MANAGER_PPROF_ADDR=127.0.0.1:6060 ./cpa-manager-plus
go tool pprof http://127.0.0.1:6060/debug/pprof/heap
```

The equivalent config-file field is `pprofAddr`. The service is disabled by default and should not be exposed through Docker port mappings or a reverse proxy.

Hourly rollup is enabled by default. The worker catches up historical events in bounded batches. Dashboard and strictly unfiltered Usage Analytics long-window core metrics reuse complete hourly data; searches and dimension, status, latency, or cache filters continue to read raw events. If the checkpoint is pending, the requested timezone cannot be represented losslessly by UTC hourly buckets, or a rollup read fails, the affected query falls back to raw events. Runtime failures are recorded through rate-limited logs. To stop background rollup temporarily, set:

```bash
USAGE_DASHBOARD_HOURLY_ROLLUP_ENABLED=false
```

Restart Manager Server after changing it. Dashboard and Usage Analytics will always use raw events while disabled. Except for the one-time startup format upgrade described below, disabling this runtime switch does not delete current-format rollup data. The switch is not exposed in the UI.

Historical usage archives are stored under `usage-archives/` in the resolved data directory. Each segment is a sequence-numbered gzip JSONL file (`segment-*.jsonl.gz`). Usage import reads decompressed JSONL and does not automatically decode a `.gz` file; follow the archive-recovery procedure in [Backup And Restore](./backup.md). If only `USAGE_DB_PATH` or `dbPath` overrides the database location and no data directory is explicitly configured, the archive directory is placed beside that SQLite file. When both a data directory and database path are explicit, the data directory wins, so include that separate archive location in backups. On POSIX systems Manager Server creates directories as `0700` and files as `0600`. Windows inherits the parent directory ACL, so protect the resolved archive parent so only the service account and authorized administrators can access it. SQLite stores archive runs, segments, the maintenance lock, and the event identity ledger. Manual maintenance endpoints accept the CPAMP Admin Key only:

- `POST /v0/management/usage/archives/preview` with `{"cutoff_timestamp_ms": ...}` previews the eligible event count and estimated size.
- `POST /v0/management/usage/archives` with the same `{"cutoff_timestamp_ms": ...}` body creates a `previewed` run.
- `GET /v0/management/usage/archives?limit=20` returns recent sanitized run summaries.
- `GET /v0/management/usage/archives/{id}` returns sanitized progress and segment metadata.
- `POST /v0/management/usage/archives/{id}/resume` continues archiving or a failed stage.
- `POST /v0/management/usage/archives/{id}/verify` re-reads the manifest, segment checksums, and event digest.
- `POST /v0/management/usage/archives/{id}/delete` deletes raw rows in bounded batches only after the archive is verified and every required derived read path covers the run target.
- `POST /v0/management/usage/archives/{id}/cancel` abandons a run before raw deletion starts. Published archive files, segment metadata, and the identity ledger remain; raw usage is not deleted. `previewed` runs without published segments and `failed` pre-delete runs (`archiving` or `verifying` resume status) before raw deletion starts can be cancelled. Cancelling a failed pre-delete run safely releases its archive event references while preserving existing archive files and ledger rows. `archiving`, `verifying`, `deleting`, stable `archived` or `verified` runs, `failed` runs after raw deletion starts, and `completed` runs cannot be cancelled.
- `HEAD /v0/management/usage/maintenance` is an Admin-Key-only capability probe; a supported Manager Server returns `204 No Content`.
- `GET /v0/management/usage/maintenance` returns raw/deleted counts, the active run and lock, migration and aggregate readiness, plus SQLite page/freelist and file-size statistics.

Creating a run never deletes raw rows immediately. A manual `resume` returns a coverage conflict while the cache-accounting migration is incomplete; after that migration completes, it finishes any pending response-metadata backfill before writing the first segment. Stable manual `archived` and `verified` runs do not block a later manual archive, so archive/verify can be used without enabling deletion; automatic-retention runs remain active until their delete stage completes. Abandoning a task never deletes raw rows, published archive segments, or identity-ledger entries. For a failed pre-delete archiving or verifying run, cancellation also releases that run's active archive event references and the maintenance lock so the underlying raw events can participate in future maintenance. Deletion is allowed only after the archive files, manifest, and identity ledger have been verified and the cache-accounting migration, permanent hourly aggregate, pricing and monitoring rollups, monitoring search index, and account-history checkpoint are ready through the run target. Current Dashboard coverage is validated through the permanent hourly aggregate, not the retired `dashboard_hourly` checkpoint. `GET /v0/management/usage/maintenance` summarizes the primary readiness signals, while the delete operation repeats the complete gate inside each bounded transaction. The same run can be resumed after a process restart or interruption. A cancelled run is not auto-resumed and does not block a later manual or retention run. Deletion removes only `usage_events` rows; archive files and the identity ledger remain, so re-importing archived events stays idempotent. This workflow never runs SQLite `VACUUM` online. Automatic retention is disabled by default and does not start while `USAGE_DASHBOARD_HOURLY_ROLLUP_ENABLED=false`; enable it only after checking archive-disk capacity and rehearsing recovery.

Monitoring analytics responses include a `coverage` object when either the current query range or its summary-comparison range intersects raw history deleted after a verified archive. Current-range and comparison-range raw/deleted counts are reported independently and are time-range counts that are not narrowed by provider, model, account, search, or other analytics filters. The object also reports `core_aggregate_used` and machine-readable `fidelity_limitations`. Permanent hourly aggregates and event projections can continue to serve supported summary, model, and timeline totals accurately, but raw-only event details, latency percentiles, distributions, failure diagnostics, credential timelines, or unsupported searches can be incomplete. The Monitoring and Usage Analytics pages display this limitation instead of treating missing raw rows or zero-valued raw-only fields as complete history.

Every start or resumption of raw cleanup re-reads the manifest and all segments before deleting the first batch, checking file permissions, checksums, and the event digest instead of trusting the earlier `verified` state alone. If an archive has been lost or corrupted since verification, the run stops in a recoverable deletion-failure state without deleting further raw rows or identity-ledger entries. Restore that run's original archive files from a trusted backup before resuming the same run; do not bypass verification or edit deletion progress manually.

The Usage Maintenance page is available only when the panel is hosted by Manager Server and the Manager Service is available. A regular CPA-hosted panel does not show this entry. The page can run preview/create/resume/verify/delete/cancel and report reclaimable space, but physical compaction remains an offline CLI operation.

The workspace has two tabs, **Archive management** and **Import / export**, with records as the default view.

- **Archive management**: review online details, cleaned details, total SQLite file size, and reclaimable space, then filter archive records by status or source. The already-archived count is a subset of online details; open the online time range when needed.
- **New archive**: open the drawer from the toolbar, choose archive only or archive followed by cleanup, select a cutoff, review the preview, and confirm archiving. The preview counts only online events that are not already archived. The cutoff applies to this operation; it does not configure automatic retention. Estimated source size is neither the archive file size nor the amount of disk space that will be released.
- **Continue in place and inspect details**: the same drawer connects range confirmation, execution, results, and follow-up actions. Archive-only work finishes after verification and online details remain available. Cleanup requires a separate confirmation for the entire identified archive record. A cutoff selected for a new archive does not narrow the cleanup range of an existing record. Expand technical fields and segments as needed, or continue a failed stage. Stopping the browser wait does not cancel the current server job. Reopening the record reads its actual server state; cancellation eligibility still follows the existing lifecycle rules.
- **Import / export**: the default view lists the latest 20 import sessions. File selection, confirmation, progress, and results appear in a drawer, with the same pause, resume, and cancellation interaction as Monitoring. Resume with the original file. Uploading 100% still requires server processing; failed or unsupported records and warnings are reported separately. Exports contain current online details, not already-deleted archive contents, and do not replace a complete disaster-recovery backup. Existing import and export entry points remain available in other deployment modes.
- **Storage and compaction, and diagnostics**: open these from **More maintenance** in the toolbar for complete backup requirements, offline compaction instructions, coverage, storage, and lock information.

The URL preserves the tab, purpose, cutoff, status and source filters, selected record, and drawer. Refresh and browser history restore views and read state; they never create an archive or start cleanup automatically. On phones, drawers fill the screen and keep their footer actions visible. If cleanup succeeds but a subsequent storage refresh fails, the page retains the successful result and offers a read-only refresh instead of repeating cleanup.

### Reclaim SQLite Space While Stopped

Logical deletion normally does not shrink the SQLite file immediately. Before compacting, back up the complete data set as described in [Backup And Restore](./backup.md), stop every Manager Server connected to the database, and reserve temporary free space conservatively equal to at least the current database-file size. Static `previewed`, `archived`, `verified`, and `failed` runs do not block compaction; recorded maintenance locks and active `archiving`, `verifying`, or `deleting` stages do. Pending derived-data migrations are allowed and their checkpoint state is preserved exactly. Never delete WAL, SHM, or a maintenance lock manually.

Native package:

```bash
cpa-manager-plus compact-usage --db-path ./data/usage.sqlite
```

Docker Compose, after stopping the service:

```bash
docker compose stop cpa-manager-plus
docker compose run --rm --no-deps cpa-manager-plus \
  compact-usage --db-path /data/usage.sqlite
docker compose up -d cpa-manager-plus
```

Windows PowerShell, after stopping the service:

```powershell
.\cpa-manager-plus.exe compact-usage --db-path .\data\usage.sqlite
```

The command acquires the same process-level database lock used by Manager Server, opens one SQLite connection with exclusive access, runs `quick_check`, foreign-key validation, `wal_checkpoint(TRUNCATE)`, `VACUUM`, `integrity_check`, and a second foreign-key validation, then compares logical usage summaries before and after compaction. It prints before/after database, WAL, SHM, page, and freelist statistics. It does not create an archive, delete raw rows, rewrite archive files, advance derived-data migrations, or touch `data.key`. A stale maintenance lock still blocks compaction. If it belongs to a resumable active or failed run, start Manager Server and resume that run; if it remains for an inactive or terminal run, preserve the backup and logs and stop for diagnosis. Never delete the lock manually. Preserve the database and complete backup set after a failure.

When upgrading to the lossless model encoding, Manager Server resets the format of the legacy `usage_dashboard_hourly_rollups` and its `dashboard_hourly` checkpoint. This compatibility migration does not modify or delete `usage_events` and does not reset the account-history rollup. Current Dashboard and Usage Analytics reads use the permanent hourly aggregate. The runtime no longer starts the legacy Dashboard hourly worker and does not wait for its checkpoint. When hourly aggregation is enabled, the background worker maintains the current permanent hourly aggregate in bounded batches; relevant queries fall back to raw events according to their read-path rules while its coverage is not ready.

When upgrading an existing database, Manager Server performs schema and metadata changes plus any required derived-rollup reset during startup, but does not scan historical `usage_events`. Cache-accounting corrections that require a historical event scan begin in the background after the HTTP listener is bound, processing 1,000 rows per batch. Candidate scanning, event correction, and derived-row clearing each use bounded transactions with committed progress, so a restart resumes the active phase without repeating completed batches. Readers use raw events while corrected history is being applied or stale rollups are being cleared.

While the migration is running:

- Newly collected events are written in the new format and are outside the legacy migration target range.
- Account-history and dashboard-hourly rollup catch-up is paused to avoid building summaries from partially migrated data.
- Logs report migration start, progress, retryable failures, and completion.
- `GET /status` exposes `status`, `lastEventId`, `targetEventId`, `processedRows`, `changedRows`, and `appliedRows` under `dataMigration`; low-level migration error text is not returned.

After completion, the response-metadata backfill and both rollup workers continue automatically. Do not start a second Manager Server against the same SQLite database or CPA queue to accelerate the migration.

Historical rollup rebuilding and stale-row cleanup run only after the HTTP listener is available. Startup index preparation is deliberately bounded: Manager Server creates a missing index only when its target table is empty and the index name is not retained by a parked table. Indexes for non-empty tables and retained names are logged as deferred so collector startup is not delayed by a large index build. During a rebuild, queries use the current complete revision or fall back to raw `usage_events`; an interrupted batch resumes from its committed checkpoint after restart. These tasks must not modify or delete `usage_events`.

This listener-first policy lets a large historical database expose HTTP promptly after an upgrade. Until deferred indexes or offline cleanup are complete, however, historical queries can fall back to wider scans and temporary sorts. Manager Server exposes a stable, sanitized, automatically recoverable summary under `databaseMaintenance` in `GET /status`; System Info, the global warning, and Request Monitoring all use the same state:

```json
{
  "databaseMaintenance": {
    "required": true,
    "performanceDegraded": true,
    "deferredIndexes": 10,
    "offlineJobs": 1,
    "reasons": ["deferred_indexes", "offline_derived_cleanup"],
    "command": "cleanup-derived"
  }
}
```

The maintenance check reads SQLite schema metadata and cleanup-job metadata, plus bounded existence probes for target tables whose indexes are missing. It does not scan or count all of `usage_events`. The global warning refreshes through the same `/status` endpoint with the lightweight `?scope=database-maintenance` view, avoiding the full runtime counters. The `databaseMaintenance` object adds no absolute database path, raw SQL, or index names; the full `/status` response retains its existing fields for compatibility. After offline maintenance completes and Manager Server restarts, it derives the state again from the real database metadata, so `required`, `deferredIndexes`, and `offlineJobs` return to clean automatically without a manual reset.

An upgraded database can retain an old request-monitoring FTS generation after its paired projection rows have been removed in bounded online batches. It can also have deferred indexes for populated tables or an obsolete quota-cooldown identity index that must be replaced offline. In the exceptional case where one legacy quota observation group exceeds the safe online batch limit, the migration is marked `offline_required` and logs `offline cleanup required`; the original snapshot fallback remains available. When logs report deferred index preparation, `cleanup requires offline finalization`, or `offline cleanup required`, or when the UI or `/status` reports unfinished database maintenance, stop every Manager Server process using the database and run the same-version binary once.

Docker Compose:

```bash
docker compose stop cpa-manager-plus

docker compose run --rm --no-deps \
  cpa-manager-plus \
  cleanup-derived --db-path /data/usage.sqlite

docker compose start cpa-manager-plus
```

Native installation:

```bash
cpa-manager-plus cleanup-derived
# Or select the database explicitly
cpa-manager-plus cleanup-derived --db-path /path/to/usage.sqlite
```

Manager Server holds an operating-system lock at `<absolute-database-path>.manager.lock` for its entire lifetime, and the command refuses to run while that lock is held. The web UI therefore detects, explains, and shows the steps only; it does not offer an online repair button, spawn the cleanup command, or bypass the process lock. The lock file itself is persistent and does not need to be deleted; stop the Manager Server process and retry instead. Symbolic-link aliases resolve to the same lock, while databases with multiple hard links are rejected because SQLite WAL/SHM sidecars cannot safely share those aliases. Back up the SQLite database plus `data.key` before offline maintenance. The command prepares deferred indexes, replaces obsolete derived indexes, completes oversized legacy quota observation groups, and removes obsolete derived FTS/projection generations. It never deletes, rebuilds, or rewrites authoritative `usage_events`.

When `USAGE_QUOTA_COOLDOWN_ENABLED`, `USAGE_ACCOUNT_ACTIONS_ENABLED`, or `USAGE_ACCOUNT_ACTIONS_AUTO_DISABLE` is set through the environment, the matching panel switch is shown as environment-sourced and locked. Remove the environment variable and restart Manager Server if you want the setting to be editable from the panel.

After setup, Manager Server management endpoints require:

```text
Authorization: Bearer <CPAMP_ADMIN_KEY>
```

:::

## Data And Security

Back up:

```text
usage.sqlite
usage.sqlite-wal
usage.sqlite-shm
data.key
usage-archives/
```

Security notes:

- The admin key is not stored in plaintext; only a salted HMAC credential is stored.
- CPA Management Keys saved through setup or the panel are encrypted before being stored in SQLite.
- If `usage.sqlite` leaks without `data.key`, the saved CPA Management Key is not directly readable.
- If both `usage.sqlite` and `data.key` leak, the saved CPA Management Key can be decrypted.
- If `data.key` is lost, the saved CPA Management Key cannot be recovered.
- For manual env/secret deployments, also back up the matching secret files. After a successful one-click import, back up SQLite together with `data.key`; keep the temporary secret for retry if the import failed or execution was skipped.
- Request metadata may contain model names, endpoints, account labels, project snapshots, token usage, latency, and failure summaries.
- Raw failure bodies stay local in SQLite. Normal APIs and JSONL exports expose sanitized summaries instead of raw diagnostic bodies.
- Archive JSONL files may contain event-level `fail_body` and `raw_json`; protect them with the same access controls as the live SQLite database.

## Import And Export

Manager Server exports JSONL / NDJSON usage events.

It can import:

- JSONL / NDJSON exported by Manager Server.
- Legacy usage snapshots only when request-level details exist.

Large files use resumable chunk sessions, with total size bounded by `USAGE_IMPORT_DISK_QUOTA_BYTES`. When a browser resumes a server session with an uploaded prefix it incrementally computes the prefix SHA-256 and the server verifies the persisted digest; the newly selected file must have the same content, not merely the same name, size, or `lastModified`. A mismatch requires a new import and no further chunk is uploaded. Legacy sessions with an uploaded prefix but no digest are not resumed. Each JSONL record or individual object in a legacy snapshot `details` array must be no larger than 10 MiB; chunked upload does not relax this per-record limit.

Aggregate-only legacy files cannot reconstruct request-level monitoring. Test imports against a backup or staging database when accuracy matters.
