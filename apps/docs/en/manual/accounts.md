# Accounts And Credential Health

`/accounts` is CPAMP's unified credential-management entry. It combines the former auth-file, account-quota, and inspection state into one workspace that answers: which accounts exist, whether they are enabled, whether they can serve requests now, and which accounts need reauthentication or manual review.

Use [OAuth Login](./oauth.md) to add OAuth accounts. Import, editing, status decisions, and troubleshooting after the credential is saved belong in Accounts.

Open the unified [Accounts Demo](https://seakee.github.io/CPA-Manager-Plus/#/demo/accounts) to inspect fictional credentials, quota, inspection, and automation state.

## What To Check First

- **Credential and provider**: confirm whether the account belongs to Codex, Claude, Vertex, Antigravity, Kimi, xAI, Devin, or another source.
- **`auth_index`**: the stable account index used to connect usage, quota, inspection, and account actions.
- **Enabled state**: automated recovery does not override manually disabled accounts.
- **Note, priority, and project ID**: use them to separate account purpose and routing preference.
- **Account health**: combines credential state, the latest inspection, Provider queries, response Headers, cooldowns, and pending actions.
- **Quota windows**: shows confirmed usage, reset, source, and observation time. Unknown does not mean unlimited.

Keep `auth_index` stable in multi-account deployments. File-name-only identity is not sufficient for reliably joining history and operational state to one account.

## Common Actions

- Refresh the credential list or explicitly refresh Provider quota for one credential.
- Paste JSON, upload, download, edit, disable, restore, or delete credentials.
- Filter by search, provider, state, plan, quota window, or operational state.
- Batch change priority or enabled state, and toggle WebSockets for selected Codex credentials.
- Inspect overview, configuration, supported models, quota history, and diagnostic evidence.
- Run local or Manager Server Codex/xAI inspection from the health workspace.

If you are unsure whether an account is still needed, disable it before deleting it. Disable preserves history joins; deletion makes later inspection, quota, and action tracking harder.

## Add Or Update Credentials

1. Complete [OAuth Login](./oauth.md) for OAuth accounts.
2. Paste or upload JSON when credentials already exist.
3. Confirm the provider, account, file name, and `auth_index` after saving.
4. Send one low-cost request.
5. Open [Monitoring](./monitoring.md) and confirm the request used the expected account.

Official Sub2API multi-account exports are converted in the browser into independent CPA Codex credentials. Empty exports, malformed fields, and partial upload failures produce explicit results; a top-level array is not silently saved as one ordinary credential file.

## Quota And Health Evidence

Account state may come from:

- Provider quota queries explicitly started by the user.
- Local or Manager Server Codex/xAI inspection results.
- Safe response Headers from recent successful requests.
- Failure summaries such as `usage_limit_reached`, HTTP `401`, `402`, or `429`.
- Manager Server quota cooldowns and account-action candidates.

Provider quota refresh remains explicit. Opening Accounts, reading history, or passively loading Header evidence does not poll upstream quota endpoints. Muse / Meta quota refresh reads the DCA from the current physical auth file and asks Meta through CPA; the DCA is never used as an inference API key.

CPAMP reconciles evidence by credential identity and observation time. Newer healthy evidence can supersede older reauth, quota-limit, cooldown, and action-candidate state; a newer `401` or explicit quota exhaustion remains authoritative. After reauthentication, inspection and quota evidence from the replaced credential cannot reattach to the new credential.

| Provider        | Possible evidence                                                              | Boundary                                                                                            |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Codex           | Five-hour/weekly windows, reset, Headers, workspace, and inspection state      | Fields depend on plan and API responses.                                                            |
| Claude          | Base quota, weekly quota, and model-scoped limits                              | Scoped limits can be duplicated, missing, or inactive; CPAMP groups them by identity and freshness. |
| xAI/Grok OAuth  | CLI billing weekly/monthly data, official API identity, and request exhaustion | Official API identity does not provide queryable cost or remaining percentages.                     |
| Muse / Meta     | `meta:window`, `meta:weekly`, and reset/period metadata                         | Missing usage percentages remain unknown rather than becoming `0%`; DCA is limited to account/quota flows. |
| Other providers | CPA credential metadata or recent response Headers                             | No common active quota API is assumed.                                                              |

## Quota Cooldown And Account Actions

When quota cooldown is enabled and a supported account reaches a strict exhaustion signal, CPAMP can temporarily disable the related credential and restore it after recovery. Auto-restore only affects credentials disabled by that cooldown record; it does not override manual, inspection-owned, or authentication-failure disables.

Quota cooldown is for clear quota exhaustion, not expired login, upstream bans, or configuration errors. Use [Account Action Queue](./account-actions.md) or [OAuth Login](./oauth.md) for those cases.

## Troubleshooting Order

1. Read status codes and sanitized failure summaries in [Monitoring](./monitoring.md).
2. Check whether the credential is manually disabled, needs reauth, or is cooling down.
3. Run [Account Inspection](./codex-inspection.md) and review provider, workspace, billing, and authentication evidence.
4. Check [Account Action Queue](./account-actions.md) for pending candidates.
5. If quota is unavailable, confirm whether the provider supports active lookup or only passive Header observation.

Use [Usage Analytics](./usage-analytics.md) for cost breakdowns; cost is not part of credential management.

## Security Notes

Credential files contain sensitive data. Do not share full JSON, OAuth tokens, API keys, Management Keys, `Set-Cookie`, or unredacted Authorization Headers. For troubleshooting, share sanitized request summaries, account-state screenshots, and log timestamps.
