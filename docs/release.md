# Release Process

This document defines the release note conventions used by the repo-local
`/release` workflow and `.github/workflows/release.yml`.

The `/release` workflow is CPA Manager Plus specific. It is suitable as a
repo-local Claude command or repo-local Codex skill, but it should not be
installed as a global cross-project skill.

`docs/release-notes/` is reserved for versioned release note files only. Do not
place process documentation or README files inside that directory.

Formal release notes are technical release records. Community-facing release
copy is authored separately so it can prioritize user value and readability
without weakening the technical notes.

## Release Branch Flow

`main` is the stable default branch. `dev` is the integration branch. Every
release follows this sequence:

```text
release/<version> -> dev -> main -> v<version> tag -> GitHub Release
```

1. Freeze the intended release scope on `dev`; do not merge unrelated work
   until the tag is created.
2. Create `release/<version>` from `dev`, add the two release-note files and
   the Telegram post, then merge its release PR into `dev` with a merge commit
   (not squash or rebase).
3. Record the resulting `dev` commit from that release PR as the release SHA.
   Before promotion, confirm that `dev` still points to that exact SHA.
4. Before opening the promotion PR, derive its `Related` section from the exact
   range between the previous `main` tip and the frozen release `dev` SHA.
   Inspect first-parent integration merges and resolve each one to its GitHub
   PR using merge-commit and PR metadata. List every distinct PR merged into
   `dev` in that range, including the release PR and feature, fix, docs, or
   chore PRs; exclude branch-synchronization merges and work already present in
   the previous `main` tip. Preserve integration order and stop if any merge
   cannot be mapped to a PR. Write one `Refs #<number>` line per PR, using
   `N/A` only when the range contains no qualifying PRs.
5. Open a same-repository `dev -> main` promotion PR with the full repository
   template and the complete `Related` list. It must pass the normal PR checks
   and the `Verify dev promotion source` gate before merging with a merge
   commit. Squash and rebase merges are rejected by release preflight.
6. Reconfirm that the resulting `main` commit contains the recorded release
   `dev` SHA, then run the release workflow dry-run from that `main` commit.
7. Create the tag from the exact `main` commit that passed the dry-run.

Do not promote `dev` immediately before starting this sequence. The release PR
must first add its three versioned files to `dev`, so a preliminary promotion
would be followed by a second mandatory promotion. The standard flow has one
`dev -> main` PR, after the Release PR is merged.

Do not open a release PR directly to `main`: branch protection permits only
the repository's `dev` branch to promote into `main`.

`main` can contain a prior `dev -> main` merge commit that is not an ancestor
of the current `dev` ref. This is normal. Before a new release, require that
`main` has no non-merge commits absent from `dev`; investigate and stop if it
does. The release scope is still invalid if `dev` advances after the release PR
is merged: refresh the notes and repeat the release preflight rather than
including unreviewed changes in the tag.

## Operator Approval Gates

Normal releases use two explicit gates rather than one confirmation per remote
operation:

1. **Integrate and validate**: approve the exact release branch and files,
   conditional Release PR merge, the single conditional `dev -> main` merge,
   temporary clean-worktree lifecycle, dry-run dispatch, and any disclosed
   scoped fallback. Both merges proceed only while their recorded head/base
   SHAs remain unchanged and all required checks pass.
2. **Tag and publish**: after the dry-run succeeds, approve the exact
   `refs/tags/<tag> -> <main-promotion-sha>` mapping. The normal Web/Actions
   path then dispatches `Build and Release` from that exact `main` SHA in
   `publish` mode with the successful dry-run ID and explicit publish
   confirmation; the workflow creates and re-reads the lightweight tag before
   continuing publication in the same run. A directly pushed approved tag
   remains a supported legacy entry path. The read-only closeout then continues
   without further confirmation.

The operator keeps an in-session manifest containing the previous `main` SHA,
source `dev` SHA, the exact promotion range and `Related` PR numbers, release
content digests, Release PR head and merge SHAs, promotion SHA, dry-run ID, tag
target, and allowed fallback operations. Any SHA drift, failed check, scope
change, incomplete PR mapping, or new side effect invalidates the current gate
and stops the flow. A dirty developer checkout is recorded and preserved;
remote operations and a detached temporary worktree are used instead of
requiring unrelated local changes to be stashed or cleaned.

## Release Note Files

```text
docs/release-notes/<tag>-<lang>.md
```

- `<tag>` keeps the `v` prefix, for example `v1.0.2` or `v1.1.0-beta.1`.
- `<lang>` is `zh` for the authored Chinese source or `en` for the English
  mirror translation. The release validator requires both exact filenames;
  historical `zh-CN` files are not used as a publishing fallback.

Examples:

```text
docs/release-notes/v1.0.2-zh.md
docs/release-notes/v1.0.2-en.md
```

### Release Metadata Block (`cpamp-update`)

Every new release's Chinese notes file (`docs/release-notes/<tag>-zh.md`) must contain **exactly one** `cpamp-update` HTML comment block containing JSON metadata.

This metadata serves as the reviewed input within the Release PR. PR validation CI validates it, and the release workflow reuses this exact block to generate the immutable `release-info.json` asset. No second metadata source is maintained.

Minimal template:

```html
<!-- cpamp-update
{
  "summary": {
    "zh": "更新说明",
    "en": "Release update"
  },
  "update": {
    "breaking": false,
    "migration_required": false,
    "minimum_direct_upgrade_version": null,
    "upgrade_guide_url": "https://github.com/seakee/CPA-Manager-Plus/releases/tag/v1.2.3"
  },
  "compatibility": {
    "minimum_cpa_version": null
  }
}
-->
```

Field requirements:
- `summary.zh`: Concise summary in Chinese (required non-empty string, max 4096 bytes).
- `summary.en`: Concise summary in English (required non-empty string, max 4096 bytes).
- `update.breaking`: Must be an explicit boolean (`true` or `false`).
- `update.migration_required`: Must be an explicit boolean (`true` or `false`).
- `update.minimum_direct_upgrade_version`: Valid SemVer tag string, or `null` if there is no lower bound for direct upgrades.
- `update.upgrade_guide_url`: Valid HTTPS URL pointing to the upgrade guide within `https://github.com/seakee/CPA-Manager-Plus/`.
- `compatibility.minimum_cpa_version`: Valid SemVer tag string, or `null` if there is no minimum CPA version requirement.

## Community Release Post

Each new release must include a reviewed Telegram post:

```text
docs/release-posts/<tag>-telegram.html
```

Example:

```text
docs/release-posts/v1.0.2-telegram.html
```

The repo-local `/release` workflow drafts this file before confirmation and
shows the exact message in the release plan. Commit it in the same release PR
as the Chinese and English release notes. Do not generate or rewrite the post
inside GitHub Actions.

Write the post for users and community members rather than code reviewers:

- use `## <M> 月 <D> 日 v<version>` as the Markdown heading, with `更新内容`,
  `注意事项`, `发布截图`, and `致谢` sections as applicable; end the Markdown
  summary and release closeout with the separate title
  `CPA-Manager-Plus [<M>月<D>日：<primary benefit>，<supporting benefit>]`;
- make the standalone title reflect the release's main user value, without
  implementation trivia; it is not part of the date/version heading;
- list every release-relevant, user-visible semantic change in `更新内容`; do
  not impose a fixed item count, but merge implementation commits that result
  in the same user behavior;
- keep each bullet to one concise sentence with the product subject and its
  user-visible result; retain necessary product terms but omit CRUD lists,
  commit/file counts, internal paths, tests, demo fixtures, and pure CI noise;
- include `注意事项` only for upgrade, data, compatibility, configuration, or
  meaningful behavior changes that users need to act on or understand;
- include `发布截图` only when a specific screen or workflow should be shown;
- keep `发布截图` and the standalone community-summary title in the Markdown
  release summary only; Telegram HTML must omit both because the workflow does
  not attach media and the title is not part of the message format;
- include acknowledgements only for external contributors and preserve their
  GitHub profile links;
- keep claims factual and grounded in the formal release notes;
- keep the complete HTML body within 3,500 characters.

Markdown community-summary template:

```markdown
## <M> 月 <D> 日 v<version>

### 更新内容

- <用户可感知的更新>

### 注意事项

- <需要升级、配置或兼容性关注的事项>

### 发布截图

<具体页面或操作路径；没有推荐时省略本节>

### 致谢

- [@contributor](https://github.com/contributor) - <贡献带来的用户价值>

CPA-Manager-Plus [<M>月<D>日：<primary benefit>，<supporting benefit>]
```

Omit optional sections that have no content. The Telegram HTML mirrors only
the applicable `更新内容`, `注意事项`, and `致谢` sections; do not append the
standalone Markdown community-summary title.

Telegram posts use a conservative HTML subset supported by the Bot API:

```text
<b> <i> <code> <a href="https://example.com">...</a>
```

Escape other HTML characters. Do not include inline keyboard JSON, bot tokens,
chat IDs, thread IDs, or any other secret in the post file. The release
workflow adds one `View Release` button at send time.

After the GitHub Release job succeeds, `.github/workflows/release.yml` reads the
tag-matched post and sends it through Telegram Bot API `sendMessage`. Configure
these repository secrets:

```text
TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN
TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID
TELEGRAM_MESSAGE_THREAD_ID  # optional, for a forum topic
```

Missing configuration or a missing post file skips the notification with an
Actions warning. Telegram delivery failure must not roll back or invalidate an
otherwise successful GitHub Release.

## Release CI Contract

`.github/workflows/release.yml` is intentionally fail-closed. A tag push must
use the strict `v<major>.<minor>.<patch>` format with an optional prerelease
suffix such as `-rc.1`; build metadata, floating tags, and malformed versions
are rejected. Numeric prerelease identifiers must not contain leading zeroes.

The PR workflow automatically validates newly added versioned files under
`docs/release-notes/` and `docs/release-posts/` before they can pass the stable
`Required checks` aggregate. The three files for each new release tag must
exist and satisfy the same content rules used by release preflight. For a
Release PR targeting `dev`, CI also resolves the first-parent integration merges
from the previous release tag through the frozen `dev` base SHA to merged PR
metadata. External PR authors (excluding the repository owner and bots) must
appear exactly once in both formal `Acknowledgements` sections and in the
Telegram `致谢` section, whose handle must link to the matching GitHub profile.
Unresolvable explicit PR merges, missing contributors, extra contributors, or
inconsistent handles fail the Release Content check.

The preflight validates all of the following before building or publishing:

- `docs/release-notes/<tag>-zh.md`, `docs/release-notes/<tag>-en.md`, and
  `docs/release-posts/<tag>-telegram.html` exist and are non-empty;
- `docs/release-notes/<tag>-zh.md` contains exactly one valid `cpamp-update`
  metadata JSON comment matching the update-contract specification;
- the two release notes contain reciprocal tag-pinned GitHub blob links;
- the candidate SHA is the current `main` tip;
- `main` is a two-parent `dev -> main` promotion merge, and `dev` is the
  two-parent release-PR merge;
- the final `main` tree exactly matches the promoted `dev` tree;
- the release merge introduces exactly the three versioned release files and
  no unrelated changes.

There is no commit-log or previous-tag fallback. A missing note or post stops
the workflow before any asset or container publishing. Run the validator
locally with:

```bash
npm run release:validate -- --tag v1.2.3 --content-only
```

For a complete topology check, provide the candidate SHA and fetched protected
refs. `Build and Release` may be dispatched only from `main` and exposes two
manual modes:

1. `dry-run` performs the complete validation and builds HTML, native packages,
   and the multi-architecture Docker image with publishing disabled. The target
   tag must not exist. Record the successful workflow run ID after its stable
   terminal observation.
2. `publish` requires the exact `expected_sha`, that successful `dry_run_id`,
   and `confirm_publish=true`. Before any Release or registry mutation, the
   workflow verifies that the prior run is the same `Build and Release`
   workflow, `dry-run` mode, version, repository, and `main` SHA; it then creates
   and re-reads `refs/tags/<tag>` at that SHA and continues publication in the
   same workflow run. A first publish attempt fails closed if the tag already
   exists. On a later attempt of the same workflow run, an existing tag is
   reusable only when it still points directly to the exact approved `main`
   SHA. The workflow deliberately does not depend on a second tag-push event,
   because refs created with `GITHUB_TOKEN` do not recursively trigger the
   release workflow.

A normal externally created approved tag remains supported and enters the same
workflow in `tag` mode. In all modes, the tag or candidate SHA must satisfy the
same release topology and content validation.

Release jobs share a non-canceling `release-publish` concurrency group, so two
release runs cannot publish concurrently. Assets are uploaded as an Actions
artifact and reused by the GitHub Release job, which prevents a second build
from silently producing a different release payload. DockerHub publishing is
optional when its credentials are absent; GHCR remains the configured image
registry for normal production publication. Docker metadata must explicitly
bind `org.opencontainers.image.revision` to the release `main` SHA,
`org.opencontainers.image.version` to the SemVer without the leading `v`, and
`org.opencontainers.image.source` to the official repository URL. After pushing
the exact version image and before publishing the draft GitHub Release, the
workflow verifies those labels, required linux/amd64 and linux/arm64 manifests,
and matching digests across every enabled registry.

After building the release artifact and before any Docker registry mutation,
the workflow reads any existing GitHub Release for the tag. A missing release
is created normally. An exact body, state, asset-name, size, and SHA-256 match
is skipped idempotently. During an explicitly approved workflow rerun, a strict
matching subset may resume by uploading only missing assets while the Release
remains mutable. Unexpected assets, immutable incomplete Releases, changed
metadata, changed content, or a partial Release on attempt 1 fail before Docker
publishing. Same-name asset overwrites remain disabled.

Telegram delivery is deliberately non-blocking after the GitHub Release is
created. The job summary records `sent`, `skipped-config`,
`skipped-missing-post`, `skipped-invalid-thread`, or `failed-delivery` without
exposing secret values. A failed notification never rolls back a successful
release. Automatic Telegram delivery runs only during workflow attempt 1, so a
full workflow rerun cannot resend an already delivered post. The Bot API
`sendMessage` request itself is attempted once because it is non-idempotent; an
ambiguous network failure is handled as a possible delivery and requires the
explicit recovery workflow rather than an automatic HTTP retry.

Recovery rules:

1. If pre-tag dry-run fails, fix the source or release files, repeat the Release
   PR/promotion as needed, and rerun the dry-run before creating a tag.
2. Never rerun a completed successful production release run. If a tag-push or
   official `publish` dispatch fails because the immutable source is invalid,
   fix it under a new version and create a new tag; never move the failed tag.
   For a transient asset or Docker failure, first identify which registries or
   Release stages already changed state, then obtain explicit recovery approval
   before rerunning the failed production workflow. For an official `publish`
   dispatch rerun, the workflow first revalidates the original successful
   dry-run and exact existing tag before resuming. A rerun may fill only missing
   Release assets whose already-published siblings still match the checked
   payload exactly and whose Release remains mutable. An incomplete immutable
   Release requires a new version or separately approved administrative
   recovery. Publishing across registries is deterministic but not transactional.
3. If GitHub Release succeeds and Telegram fails, repair the secret/post,
   verify whether a message may already have been delivered, and explicitly
   dispatch `Recover Telegram Release Notification` with its resend confirmation.
   Dispatch it from `main`. The recovery job validates the historical tag and
   complete published Release, extracts the post from the tag, and sends it with
   the current protected `main` helper. Do not recover Telegram by rerunning the
   complete release workflow.

For Actions monitoring, use the run-level state as the canonical decision
surface. Require `status=completed`, a terminal conclusion, and the same
`run_attempt` on a second observation after a 30-60 second stabilization
interval. Job-level state may provide detail but must not override a completed
successful run.

Before enabling production releases, repository administrators must enforce
the remote controls that local files cannot provide: protected `dev` and
`main` branches, a tag ruleset that permits only the release automation to
create `v*` tags, and immutable GitHub Releases/tags. Never delete, retarget,
or overwrite a published release tag as a recovery step.

## Writing Template

Chinese is the authored source. Other languages should preserve the same
structure, links, and statistics. Language switch links must be tag-pinned
GitHub blob URLs under `docs/release-notes/` because GitHub Releases render the
curated note body outside that directory.
